If you're in school and, like me, enjoy playing the "what-if" game with your grades, you might find this fun and/or helpful.

The faded green range shows your minimum and maximum course grade for finalized assignment/test grades.  The light green range shows your "hypothetical" grade range, based on grades you enter as "not final." Eventually I plan to make this into mobile app, but for now, Google Sheets works pretty well.
